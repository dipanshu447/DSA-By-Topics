# Trees

A tree is a data structure that is similar to linked list but instead of poiting to the next node in a linear fashion, each node points to a number of nodes. Tree is an non-linear data structure. 

## Terminology of Tree

- The **root** of a tree is a node with no parents, and there can be at most only one root node in a tree.

- An **Edge** refers to a link between a parent node and a child node.

- A node with no children is called **leaf node**.

- Children of the same parent are called **siblings**.

-  Any predecessor on the path of the root to that node are called the **ancestors** of that node.

- A **decendent** is basically the inverse relationship of ancestors.

- The **depth** of a node is the length of the path from the root to the node.

- The set of all nodes at a given depth is called the **level of the tree**. The root node is at level zero.

- The **height** of a node is the length of the path from that node to the deepest node.

- The **size** of a node is the number of descendents it has including itself.

## Binary Trees

A tree is called Binary tree if each node has zero child, one child or two children. 

### Types of Binary Tree

**Strict Binary Tree :** A binary tree is called strict binary tree if each node has exactly two children or no children.

**Full Binary Tree :** A binary tree is called full binary tree if each node has exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

**Complete Binary Tree :** A complete binary tree is a type of binary tree where all levels are filled with nodes, expect possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

**Perfect Binary Tree :** A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree where all interior nodes have two childrens and all leaves have the same depth or same level.

**Skew Binary Tree :** A tree which has only one child (expect leaf nodes), we call such trees skew trees. If every node has only left child then we call them left skew trees. Similarly, if every node has only right child then we call them right skew trees. Skew tree is also called **Degenerate Tree**.
