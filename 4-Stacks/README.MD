# Stacks

A stack is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at the one end called **top**. The last element inserted is the first one to be deleted. Hence, it is called the **Last in First out (LIFO)** or **First in Last out(FILO).**


#### Basic core stack operations : 

- Push (add an element to the top)
- Pop (remove the top element)
- Peek (view the top element)
- isEmpty (check if the stack is empty)
- isFull (check if the stack is full)

## Implementation 

There are many ways to implement a stack and here are some commonly used methods.

- Simple Array Implementation
- Dynamic Array Implementation
- Linked list Implementation
