### I mostly done small backtracking problems for now.

 Later, I will add these once I learn the topics in order to complete these problems 

When to learn backtracking:

- After you have a solid understanding of recursion.
- After learning DFS, because backtracking can be seen as an extension of depth-first search.
- Once you have tackled basic to intermediate problems like sorting, searching, and simple dynamic programming problems.

List of those backtracking algos :

- Binary Strings: generatomg all binary strings
- Generating k -ary Strings
- N-Queens Problem
- The Knapsack Problem -> Dynamic Programming
- Generalized Strings
- Hamiltonian Cycles -> Backtracking / Depth-First Search (DFS).
- Graph Coloring Problems ->Backtracking (general graph coloring) and Greedy Algorithm (like bipartite graphs).
